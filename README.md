# Tidy Models examples and research
This repository is meant to be used for researching the usage of Tidy Models and to create examples for personal use.
If anyone else finds any usefulness in the examples I create here, that is a bonus but not the main purpose of this repository.

The examples will be unstructured but should be commented in order to make tracking simpler.

# What is tidy models
Tidy models is a package and universe of packages in R. When I talk about tidy models i will interchangingly talk about the package `tidymodels` and the universe containing the package itself as well as other packages such as listed [here](https://www.tidymodels.org/).

The primary inspiration for this repository was the newly released book [*Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org/), which gives both a quick but somewhat in-depth insight into how the universe of packages can be used to create advanced models using readable and simple code.
